## Overview

### The Project

Live URL - [@ISC Docs WebApp](https://iscdocs-web-app.netlify.app/)
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Add Materials and Online Bookmarkable stuff using a simple form   
- Filter through content subject wise
- Also search for the material using simple search functionality

### Web app has some cons and they are listed below - 
- All the data is being stored in local storage so once you clear the local storage there is no going back.
- Web App will appear different on different devices due to data being stored in local storage as well as different on different browsers.
- Currently it is mainstreamed for academic purposes

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to create toggle elements using Vanilla Javascript using some primitive logic.
I don't feel very proud of CSS in this and  found that there is a major scope for learning and improvement especially
about Mobile first Workflow and Responsive design.
Still have ways to go around working with plain old JavaScript. But I did learn how to make a theme switcher with just css and javascript.
I learned how to use localStorage in an effective way.

### Continued development

- Make the UX rich and enriching
- Work on the Hamburger Menu and implement a flawless sliding menu
- Make CSS more compact and reduce the lines of code
- Implementation of the same Web App using React
- Adding backend to the Web App to secure user data.

### Useful resources

- [Dropdown Menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp) - This helped me with toggle different elements. 

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article/cheatsheet for Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

This was a really good fun mini project and I really enjoyed doing it. I got to know and implement many interesting things along with
my weakpoints on which I really need to work on along with brushing up the already strong points.
